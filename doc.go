// The audio package implements audio decoding and playback in a manner mirroring the Audio module of SFML.
//
// SFML stands for Simple and Fast Multimedia Library, a audio/graphics/windowing/networking library in C++.
// It is licensed under the Zlib/png license. I like it personally, being both fast, reliable and elegant in design.
//
// Under the hood, the audio package wraps OpenAL for playback, and libflac and libvorbis for decoding
// of FLAC and Ogg/Vorbis audio files.
